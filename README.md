# Sovereign Credit Rating Prediction

This project predicts sovereign credit ratings using economic, financial, and governance indicators from publicly available sources such as the World Bank, IMF, and Moody’s datasets.

## Project Objective
To develop an explainable machine learning model that classifies sovereign credit ratings and helps visualize key indicators driving ratings, with a case study on the Netherlands.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/`: Reusable Python modules for preprocessing, modeling, etc.
- `figures/`: All plots and visual outputs
- `dashboard/`: Streamlit app for interactive analysis

## Methods
- EDA and visualizations
- Random Forest & XGBoost modeling
- SHAP for explainability
- Scenario simulation via Streamlit

## Data Sources
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)
- [IMF World Economic Outlook](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)
- [Kaggle Moody’s Ratings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/...)
